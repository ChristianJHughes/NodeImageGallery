# Node Image Gallery

<b>A simple web server for serving image galleries. Users can upload images, add captions to existing images, and create custom galleries.<b>

The server is built using the node.js framework. Formidable and querystring (both npm packages) handle file uploads and page edits, respectively.

This project was an excercise in web serving tecniques. Therefore, the css isn't particualrly engaging :).
